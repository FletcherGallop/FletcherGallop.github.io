# Backstory

I've been using AWS for coming on 5 years now. I had the great privilege of starting of my professional life at an AWS consultancy, there I learnt from some amazing smart people how to think and how to craft things in AWS. Essentially, when you're doing _cloud_ you need to have the right mindset and living knowledge of the current landscape of offerings.

I was fortunate enough to go from learning robotics straight into learning cloud computing, and I started my career when cloud computing was the fresh new thing on the block. This means I have a couple of advantages, and a few disadvantages. Mostly I don't have the knowledge of how things have been done in a traditional on premise way, this means I don't always understand how the "legacy" components work naturally, I have to work at it. But it also means that I don't know the traidtional way, I am tuned to think the way of cloud, with serverless and managed service being my first approach to technical solutions.

But all that is to say that, when you want to work with the cloud computing technologies of today, you need two things, the right mindset and an awareness of the landscape. Technical skills and knowledge are required, but they come with practice and time. 

Over the holiday season this year I've been staying with some relatives who are currently learning AWS. One of them is being trained at work, the other is going it alone and using their preferred method of reference books. Now, you may flag an issue here as with a technology such as _the cloud_ then it's constantly updating and changing so creating a reference book for this would be tricky as it too would need to be continuously updated.

Now, because my family know I do this stuff as my day job, I got asked how I learnt. I explained that I used platforms like A Cloud Guru and then had on the job training. After a conversation about the different methods, the reference books came up. I wanted to have a read and see what it was that they had managed to find. 

That's where this review comes in.
