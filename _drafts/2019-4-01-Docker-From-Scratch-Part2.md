title: "Docker From Scratch Part 2: Making the Sample App"
---

_Building a basic ReactJS + NodeJS API Server + PostgreSQL Database application ready for Docker! And some lessons I learnt along the way._

## Introduction

Next step in my Docker learning journey was to actually <strong>build</strong> the application I was going to Docker-ise!

Without an application, it was just me reading and regurgitating documentation and things I'd read. There's no better way to learn than by doing. 

I'm familiar with using ReactJS and so I thought this would be a good framework to build my application with, I also had a NodeJS backend Express server. Final component was the database, my supportive manager (referred to from here on as AA) suggested that I use a PostgreSQL database. 

## Getting Started

If you want to follow my lead on this I'll be adding in code snippets so you can run it yourself. (_And I'll only be including the working code, don't worry_)
