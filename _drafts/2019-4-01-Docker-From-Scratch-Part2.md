title: "Docker From Scratch Part 2: Making the Sample App"
---

Next step in my Docker learning journey was to actually _build_ the application I was going to Docker-ise!

Without an application, it was just me reading and regurgitating documentation and things I'd read. There's no better way to learn than by doing. 

I'm familiar with using ReactJS and so I thought this would be a good framework to build my application with, I also had a NodeJS backend Express server. Final component was the database, my supportive manager (referred to from here on as AA) suggested that I use a PostgreSQL database.
