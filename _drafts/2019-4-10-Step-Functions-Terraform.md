title: "Terraforming them Step Functions"

Right! So, if I have to claim two joys in my tech life, it'd be cloud and automation. In that order. So let's do a bit of both, along with a bit of serverless too! 

## Introduction

I've recently been getting in some time to check out new services and technologies in AWS and other areas. But I've decided that right now AWS Step Functions is where it's at! I know, I know, it's not really that new. 

Step Functions was announced at Re:Invent 2016, and since then has only improved. Step Functions are now available in all regions and has more AWS Service integrations built in.

## But, what's a Step Function?
So, if you know me, you know I started out in tertiary education studying Mechatronics (Robotics to most people) and with that I have learnt quite a bit about electronics and hardware. So when I think Step Functions, I am thrown back into memories of using State Machines to describe a particular hardware system. And that's essentially what Step Functions are, they're State Machines in the cloud. 

Whilst one would use a Finite State Machine to describe binary inputs to transition state, in Step Functions things are a lot more flexible, and there are a lot possibilities opened up to you.
