title: "How to be a Better Manager for your Diverse Techs"
---

Listen to not just your seniors, but your juniors too. Diversity isn't the same as inclusion, you may have more people, but not necessarily more voices unless you do something to bring them out. 

## Introduction

This is all based on personal experiences, lessons learnt from having both good and bad leadership and management. I won't name names or shame companies. You can see where I've worked and it's not an extensive list so you can probably piece it all together anyway, so I'll try make it challenging for you to do so. 

I'll start off with yet a bit more background about me, I'm a young female. Which I don't usually like to disclose online and often not in tech communities because it can have two effects. Either people underestimate you or they tie you to some expectations that never quite fit. I like to think that I'll produce work that will stand for itself and my merit won't be based on anything one might have a bias either for or against. But when it comes to this topic and others I like to talk about then that background is necessary. 

## Why am I reading yet another post about D&I?

Diversity and inclusion. Current buzzwords around many industries, including and not limited to tech. Diversity and inclusion are very important for many reasons, but there have been some misguided and often backfiring attempts at corrective action. I recently read online (reddit of all places) someone complaining about corrective action. Their story essentially boiled down to this argument:

> What about the people that get left out when we pursue corrective action? 

It was an interesting argument, the main issue was that they, a male, felt that lesser abled women were being selected for jobs over equally or better abled men. Now, I'm against quotas and diversity hiring in more instances than not, simply because they backfire and often hurt the people they're intended to help. 

For instance, I was in an environment where the technical team was entirely men, aside from myself. When they were looking at hiring more, I'd suggested that it would be great to see some more female faces in the team. This continued on until the manager/leader said things such as "you can only lower the bar so much", and "we only hired you because we were thinking about diversity". Now whether or not they intended it, these words have stuck and they hurt. Not just because this message conflicted with other company values, but because they'd completely devalued me to a token. 

Pausing here to say that, I'm all for people and companies making a concious and visible effort to become more diverse and inclusive. But it's not just about getting in more numbers. It's about the environment and how you manage your new workforce.

## Why is managing a diverse team different?

With homogenous workforces you tend to get large groupings who think, feel and react the same. Not only that, you also will find that they'll experience the world, and be interacted with in very similar and familiar ways. 

That's not always the case when it comes to your new and inclusive team. What you'll find is that whilst you believe everyone is equal and able to do the job (given then right training etc of course, we're not substituting skill with demographic tick boxes) not everyone who comes across your team will. 

It's true and well evidenced that when women show up to a meeting they are treated differently than when a man shows up with the exact same task. It's not always a concious difference to all those involved. But we, the diverse folk, we feel it in most of the things we do. Feel free to go away and have a read of other people's stories about what they've experienced, the biases they've had to wrangle and fight against. You'll see it's a common and universal thing amongst us _diversity hires_, we don't get treated the same. 

Let's not debate how valid these experiences are. Just no. 

You as a manager or a future leader need to just accept that this is what it is, and learn how to work with your team against the tides of nonsense and bias. 

## What do I need to do differently?

Of course, I'll preface this with, this is what has been successful for me in my experience, you will have to adapt and evolve to suit your individuals. This isn't a one size fits all thing. 

My advice to you is to:

1) Check in with your people more

Checking in on your team is just good practice as a manager. But what I want you to start being more concious of is physically being there and aware when your team are working with others. At least at the start or periodically. If you are attending meetings with your team pay attention to 

2) Listen if they raise a concern

Oftentimes I've made a comment about someone not listening to me or dismissing me and I'll get a return of comments suggesting it must just be me, or "they're a good guy, I can't see them doing that intentionally". But that's often the point, you wouldn't experience the same treatment, you're one of them. Also, it's not always intentional, sometimes it's just unconcious biases or long held ideas of heirarchies in tech.

3) Introduce them as a technical capability 

It sounds obvious, but when you bring on a new person you need to make it clear to others that they're there for a job, and because they have capabilities and experience. That needs to be outlined by you as a manager.

If you have a company like ones I've worked at where you "consult" on different projects or clients, then start the interaction by stating "this is x and they're here for y, they will be your technical resource". Something clear that concisely states this person is capable and technical, you're vouching for their ability. Of course you have independent resources, they can introduce and take of themselves, but your vouching for them elevates this. I've walked into meetings before where I'm the technical delivery lead (ie, the engineer) and the male with me was just there to get the business details sorted and manage the client relationsip. But for every meeting we attended all technical questions were targeted at him, each time he would have to redirect to me and say that I'm the technical resource. This could have been headed off better, if it was outlined very clearly what the roles and capabilities were from the get go. 

This can also be done by giving them ample opportunity to display their technical capabilities. For instance, I've been in a meeting that wasn't going so well, I was being dismissed and excluded from most technical aspects of the conversation, but when my counterpart pointed to me and asked me to detail where things were with development and what I'd been working on etc. I had a ten minute spiel with a minor demo I could show. The look on the clients faces was both satisfying and irritating. To focus on the positive though, it was at that moment that they realised I was a technically capable resource and knew what I was talking about, they had evidence. 

It sounds like a silly step, but it makes a difference when you as a senior or manager, but often just as homogenous voice, can vouch for a person. 

## Rounding off

There are so many things that this topic brings up for me, but I try to remain positive in an industry that doesn't hear me yet, this is just a start to the conversation on how you can do better as an ally to diverse staff and to be a more inclusive manager. 

Talk to your people, remember that they will experience people and behaviour differently to you, and that you can make a difference simply by listening, accepting and standing with whomever it is that needs your support. I hope that one day we won't need to do all these things just for different voices to be invited to the conversation, but until that time we need you managers to do more to support and bring in the inclusion. 

Diversity is just the start, we need to ensure that we as an industry listen to different voices, hear their ideas and not dismiss people just because they don't look the way we expect an engineer or developer to look.
