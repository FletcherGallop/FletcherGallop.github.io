title: "Docker From Scratch Part 1: Kick-Off"
---

Started a new job, and with some time before the first full-time client engagement kicked off, what better to do than to learn some Docker!

I got a new job with [IntegrationQA](htttps://www.integrationqa.com). Joined earlier than expected, so what could I do but learn some new things? 

What did I pick? - Docker!
Why? - Because I'd always wanted to have a go, but had never found the right project that allowed for the extra time it would take to pick up Docker. 

The project was simple. It was to learn! Simple objective, right?

*WRONG!* First thing I learnt in my project was requirements are better defined earlier!
