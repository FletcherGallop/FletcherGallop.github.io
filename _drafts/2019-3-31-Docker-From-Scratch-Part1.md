title: "Docker From Scratch Part 1: Kick-Off"
---

_Started a new job, and with some time before the first full-time client engagement kicked off, what better to do than to learn some Docker! A brief summary of lessons learnt in professional project management._

### Introduction
I started my new job! About a month ago now. _But_, I joined earlier than expected, so what could I do but learn some new things? 

What did I pick? - *Docker*!

Why? - Because I'd always wanted to have a go, but had never found the right project that allowed for the extra time it would take to pick up Docker. 

### Starting the Project
> The project was simple. It was to learn! Simple objective, right?

*WRONG!* First thing I learnt in my project was requirements are better defined earlier! This was something that I hadn't caught on to until later in the project, after the third or fourth changed "requirement" lead to even more scope creep. 

### Managing the Scope

This was an internal project my client was my manager, but regardless of that. They were a tough client. Throwing up new ideas and changing requirements. Adding in standards. 

When you have a client, you need to be able to stop them and hold them to their requirements. Things do sometimes change as you progress through but you should always be mindful of scope creep!

Scope creep is defined as "a dreaded thing that can happen on any project, wasting money, decreasing satisfaction, and causing the expected project value to not be met." (PMI, 2009)

### Estimates aren't for the Faint of Heart

Or rather, estimates are more about how much you know yourself and how much you know the task. 

### Keep Track of What You're Learning

When you take on a learning project, make sure you keep track of what you're learning. If that's through commit messages, that's fine. But better still is to keep a local file - you can commit it too, but it's more for you than anyone else. As you're going along with your project, keep note of useful commands, websites (_if you remember_). But add in a bold heading with **"Key Learning Points"**, and under it, start a list, as you go along add in notes to self. 

In my project I had points like:
1.  _Git_ - Use `git remote prune origin` when suffering with dead references in origin.
2. REST APIs should return a representation of any object created when a POST method is used.
 
I'll go over the technical side to those learning points later in the _Docker From Scratch_ series.
