title: "Docker From Scratch Part 1: Kick-Off"
---

_Started a new job, and with some time before the first full-time client engagement kicked off, what better to do than to learn some Docker! A brief summary of lessons learnt in professional project management._

### Introduction
I started my new job! About a month ago now. _But_, I joined earlier than expected, so what could I do but learn some new things? 

What did I pick? - *Docker*!

Why? - Because I'd always wanted to have a go, but had never found the right project that allowed for the extra time it would take to pick up Docker. 

### Starting the Project
> The project was simple. It was to learn! Simple objective, right?

*WRONG!* First thing I learnt in my project was requirements are better defined earlier! This was something that I hadn't caught on to until later in the project, after the third or fourth changed "requirement" lead to even more scope creep.
