_I went to a code club for kids and I've walked away with a few things on my mind._

## TL;DR

>Join in and help encourage our youth to be excited and passionate about the world of tech. Not every child has immediate access to tech role models, let's do something to change that.

## Introduction

I was recently at a conference where I met a friendly local software engineer, he's a parent, and he's running a Code Club at his daughter's school.

We were chatting about the state of diversity in IT after a discussion at the conference had brought the topic up. I was explaining to him that I was discouraged by my teachers and peers from entering into the IT world as it's a man's world and it would be hard to make it. 

He'd said that he was worried about his daughter's generation, there are initiatives in- and outside of schools to bring more women in to STEM. 
But they're often being run by men like himself. I volunteered to come along and show the girls in his club that there are friendly female faces in the tech industry. 

## Storytime: My History in STEM

Whilst at school I was academic, I have always enjoyed learning, and from a young age I showed an aptitude for Maths, and Science. 

I come from a family of Engineers, Programmers and Scientists. My father is a space science programmer who does amazing things like hike up to Svalbard to program a radar. My mother is a science and maths teacher, who has always had a passion for learning and teaching, and all things science. On both sides of my family I have engineers, on my maternal side, an aeronautics engineer, on my paternal, a radio engineer. I have a cousin who works at CERN, another that has created amazing pieces of hardware. 
Everywhere I look I have smart and technical people that I look up to and who share my interests in all things nerdy. 

That's why when people would openly discourage me from entering the world of Engineering and Computer Science, I didn't listen. I looked around me, and had support from so many members of my family that it didn't matter. 
That and I'm a little stubborn. 

But this isn't the case for everyone, and that's why things like CodeClubNZ spark a joy inside me. If I had something like that available to me when I was younger I would have jumped on it. 

## What Does a Code Club Offer?

You might think that Code Club just gives kids a space to learn how to code at a young age. 

That we're just preparing them for their Digital Native lives. That's what this generation is called, the digital native generation. 

>These kids have been born into a world where having multiple devices is common and assumed. 

The benefits of Code Club are obvious, children can learn some technical skills, local technical people can give back to the community, and teachers can have a couple hours break whilst we're there working with their kids. 

But most observers are missing the most important benefit of having something like Code Club running for these children. 

Just by letting them know that we exist, that there are adults who share their interests is invaluable to them as small humans. 

Growing up, you need someone you can look up to, or that reflects your interests, if only to give you the courage to continue them. When you're young, the world is amazing, there are so many things to look at and explore. 

When you find something you enjoy, whether that be a sport, hobby or computers. You want someone around you to see that thing too and share your passion. 

When that person is an adult you get two things, a **role model/inspiration**, and **confirmation** that what you enjoy is something valid. 

That **validation** is important, it tells them that what they're doing isn't some stupid nerdy interest, but is something amazing to be enjoyed and cherished. That it's something they should pursue. 

## What Should I Do?

I was lucky enough to have validation from within my own family, I didn't have to look far to see that what I was interested in and good at was something that I could do in my adult life as a career. 

But not all kids are that lucky. **We need more technical people getting involved with our youth.**

> Saying it's a cool idea is not enough. Time to act.

It's an age old tale, there is plenty of verbal encouragement and support for initiatives like CodeClubNZ. But we need bodies in classrooms. 

It is important that we do this now, and that we do this properly. 
Initiatives need support from volunteers to make things happen. There are many different clubs and groups around NZ and globally that do things like this. Find one near you.

Different perspectives are important to the innovation and diversity of thought in technology. We, as an industry, need the kids who have the passion and joy for technology and learning. So, we must put in the time and effort to ensure that they don't have to look far to find encouragement and support.
