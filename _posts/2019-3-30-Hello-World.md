_Finally did it! Finally started a blog! Introducing you to my blog and to me._

### The Bit Where I Talk about the Blog
I've been looking at starting a blog for while but couldn't settle on the best way to do it. But I've recently made myself some new goals I actually plan to stick to this time, and so, I set myself some time this weekend and I started!

Using a few guides, and the amazing template - [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) - which was started by [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark), I built my blog using GitHub pages!

Will be aim to put up at least one blog a month. Beginning with "Docker From Scratch" one of my most recent learning/exploring projects. 

### The Bit Where I Talk About Myself
I will be trying to post about the things I learn. I've recently graduated as a Computer Science major from Victoria University of Wellington. 
I've been working in industry throughout my degree, working over the summers and then working part-time my final year.

I've worked at a small start-up called API Talent, which was then acquired by Deloitte, and so I went with the team to join at Deloitte. It was at a conference that I met some of the team from [IntegrationQA](https://www.integrationqa.com). And it wasn't long before I'd joined their team!

I'm loving the new place, they're all very supportive. I get feedback regularly and very frequently. I get asked to join in with the different activities to see what I can contribute. It's all a very welcoming and valuable experience. 

I did one crazy thing when they were asking me what it would take to get me to work with them. I asked for 1/2 a day every week to work on my professional development.
