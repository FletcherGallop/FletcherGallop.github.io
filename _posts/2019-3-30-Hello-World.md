Finally did it! Finally started a blog!

Using a few guides, and the amazing template - [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) - which was started by [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark). 

Will be aim to put up at least one blog a month. Beginning with "Docker From Scratch" one of my most recent learning/exploring projects.
