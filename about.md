Cloud Engineer and Serverless Enthusiast!

## Brief History
I was born in the UK and then moved between the UK and New Zealand growing up. 

I currently live and work in Wellington, New Zealand.

## Skills
I've worked with AWS for a few years now, have 3 certs:
- AWS Cloud Practitioner
- AWS Certified Developer - Associate
- AWS Certified Architect - Associate

I'm exploring the world of Google Cloud as well, and I recently (May '19) got my Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer certification.

Worked with Mobile and Web development, favourite frameworks include:
- ReactJS (Web)
- ReactNative (Mobile)
- Ionic/Angular (Mobile)

But I'm always looking to learn and pick up new tech that catches my eye!
